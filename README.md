# CARBONARA                     
# butchered jshielder script for superlazy roots
# tweaked for CIS hardening of Ubuntu 18.04
                                               
Carbonara not because diamonds are the hardest, purest, densest form of carbon, hardest crap in whole of nature!
Carbonara because this script resembles Spaghetti very much, Spaghetti Carbonara, junk food made from overburned, carbonized bacon and powdered eggs...
