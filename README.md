# CARBONARA                     
# originally awesome jshielder hardening script, butchered cruely by yours trully to support lazy-ass root bretheren of the world
# intended for hardening of Ubuntu 18.04 according to CIS standards, without moving a pinky...
                                               
Carbonara not because diamonds are the hardest, purest, densest form of carbon, the hardest crap in whole damn nature...
Carbonara because it resembles spaghetti, Spaghetti Carbonara, trashy food made from carbonized bacon, spaghetti and eggs...

Also, it's done in 5.
